   + One of the metrics we examined was revenue by product line. This allowed us to identify which product lines were generating the most revenue for the dealer. By understanding which products are selling well, the dealer can focus their resources and marketing efforts on those particular product lines to drive further growth.

   + In addition to analyzing revenue by product line, we also looked at revenue by country. This helped us to understand which countries the dealer was generating the most revenue from. By identifying their top-performing countries, the dealer can develop more targeted marketing campaigns and sales strategies for those regions.

   + Another important metric we analyzed was monthly sales by country. By understanding how sales fluctuate month-to-month in different countries, the dealer can better forecast demand and adjust their inventory levels accordingly. This can help to prevent stock shortages or overstocking, both of which can negatively impact profitability.

  + I also examined quantity distribution and sale distribution metrics to gain a more granular understanding of the dealer's sales patterns. By analyzing quantity distribution, we could see which products were selling in large volumes, and which were selling in smaller quantities. This can help the dealer make more informed decisions about their inventory and stock levels.

   + Finally, by analyzing sales distribution, i were able to identify which products were generating the highest sales volumes, and which were generating lower sales volumes. This information can be used to help the dealer optimize their pricing strategies, and develop new sales and marketing initiatives to drive sales growth.

   Here are a few recommendations:
   + Pricing optimization: By analyzing sales distribution, we can identify products that are selling well and those that are not. For products that are selling well, we can consider raising the price slightly to increase profit margins. For products that are not selling well, you might consider lowering the price to increase sales volume.
   Here are a few options that can consider not to lower price: Bundling Sale, Targeted promotions.
   + Product development: By identifying products that are selling well, you can invest in product development initiatives to build on that success. We might consider expanding the product line by introducing new products that are similar to the top-performing products.
   + Marketing initiatives: We can use the insights from sales distribution to develop targeted marketing campaigns to promote the top-performing products: might offer discounts or other promotions to encourage customers to buy these products.


   

Overall, by analyzing these key metrics, i have been able to provide the Specialty Toy Vehicle Dealer with valuable insights into their business performance, and help them to make more informed decisions to drive growth and profitability.
